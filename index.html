            Robert Miller, the president and founder of Travel Advocates, was on pace for his best year ever in 2020 when Covid hit. His business, which helps large groups book travel and accommodations throughout the US, earned two-thirds of its revenue from foreigners traveling to the US. The most popular destination was New York City. Now, less than one-fourth of his customers are international travelers, and New York has plummeted in its popularity amongst his clientele.
        </p>
 
        <p> 
            “We had virtually no international business coming to the States over the last 2 years,” Miller said. “We are finally seeing international business return.” 
        </p>

        <p> 
            As the US economy continues its long emergence from the harms of the Covid pandemic, international tourism is one of the last areas to recover. While domestic tourism has had a strong recovery, international tourism is uniquely important because foreign travelers take longer trips and spend more money than domestic travelers. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Economists and industry experts have attributed the lagging recovery to a handful of factors. The US has kept strict Covid travel restrictions for foreigners, including requiring tests and proof of vaccination. Some countries, like China and New Zealand, have their own restrictions making it difficult for their citizens to travel internationally. Political and economic uncertainty, including the Russia-Ukraine War, has also hurt the number of incoming travelers.

            For Vijay Dandapani, the president of the NYC Hotel Association, the travel restrictions have played a large role in the harm that Covid has done to New York’s hotels. “We are the only country in the developed world that still has a testing requirement,” Dandapani said. “That's a pretty huge deterrent.”        
        </p>

        <p>
            In November, President Joe Biden lifted an 18-month ban on travel from 33 countries, including China and much of the European Union. The lift only applied to fully vaccinated travelers, who now need to show proof of vaccination and a negative Covid test within three days of traveling.
        </p>

        <p> 
            International travel to the US fell dramatically in 2020, but New York City may have been hit the hardest. In 2019, about 13.5 million people traveled to New York. In 2020, that number fell by more than 90 percent, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. That dramatic hit has been largely attributed to the city’s own coronavirus response, where proof-of-vaccination and mask mandates were stricter than in other tourism capitals like Florida and Nevada.
        </p>

        <p> 
            The lack of foreign visitors has sent ripples across the economy. In New York, more than 100 hotels in the city have remained closed since the start of the Covid pandemic, some permanently. Hotels employ about 20,000 fewer New Yorkers compared with before the pandemic, according to the NYC Hotel Association. Nationally, that number is almost half a million, according to the American Hotel and Lodging Association. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Citywide revenues for hotels are still down 25% from 2019, according to Dandapani’s organization, which advocates for hotels across the city. Dandapani forecasts a gradual recovery in international travel to NYC for the next two years, with the city reaching pre-pandemic numbers in 2024. Accommodating pre-pandemic numbers of tourists will require increased investment. With so many hotels closing down, New York City lost more than 20,000 hotel rooms within which to house those travelers.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hotels aren’t the only businesses that lost jobs due to a lack of travelers though. Robert Miller was forced to lay off all but a handful of his staff when Covid-driven PPP loans expired in June 2020. The only employees Miller kept on were a handful who helped process cancellations by former customers. Those employees accepted lower wages rather than losing their jobs.
        </p>

        <p>
            “We had to stretch what dollars were left,” Miller said. He pivoted the business towards domestic travelers, who had saved up money from the early days of Covid and were desperately looking to get out of their homes and travel. That move paid off, as his business was able to weather the storm. Now, with international travel potentially recovering, he forecasts a strong 2022. He’s also been able to rehire almost every employee that he laid off. “Getting our ‘family’ back working together is the best feeling,” Miller said.
        </p>

        <p>
            Though New York City has been hurting much more than the rest of the country, one explanation for the slow recovery of international travel is that the average American is much better off today than their overseas counterparts. This trend has been reflected in the US trade balance—which counts international tourism as an exported service—where the growing deficit has shown that Americans, largely buoyed by stimulus, have spent heavily. “The US consumer has been so strong relative to the consumer elsewhere in the world,” said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Financial Markets. “Foreign tourists can really drive the experience-orientated sector and travel and leisure to do much better.”
        </p>

        <p>
            New York City Mayor Eric Adams has spent ample time talking about the importance of getting tourists back to his city. "My administration is laser-focused on driving tourism in this city and letting the world know that New York City is back," said Mayor Adams in an address in late March. "Our hospitality and tourism industry have long been an engine of economic prosperity that impacts all New Yorkers.”
        </p>

        <p>
            Adams and his team have set the goal of exceeding pre-pandemic tourism numbers in 2024. While the plan to achieve it focuses on economic investment, inclusion, and job training, Adams has also enacted policies that reduce Covid restrictions, like ending some mask mandates and proof-of-vaccination requirements. For the entire country’s international tourism industry to recover, they may need to take similar measures.
